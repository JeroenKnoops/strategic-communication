# strategic-communication
A best-of-breed language with a holistic approach to moving the needle.

## Example program
This program prints the numbers 0 to 9 to stdout separated by newlines:
```
align revenue streams with Engineering and HR
revamp revenue streams
align stakeholder engagement with Finance and Manufacturing
align customer experience with PR and HR
moving forward, loop
deliver customer experience
deliver stakeholder engagement
innovate customer experience
innovate revenue streams
restructure revenue streams to loop
```
Translated to pseudocode:
```
revenue_streams = -10
stakeholder_engagement = 48 // '0'
customer_experience = 30 // '\n'
do {
  print(customer_experience)
  print(stakeholder_engagement)
  customer_experience++
  revenue_streams++
} while revenue_streams < 0
```

## Register names
* customer experience
* revenue streams
* core competencies
* best practices
* stakeholder engagement
* key performance indicators
* return on investment
* assets

## Constants
* 0: HR
* 1: Engineering
* 2: Legal
* 3: PR
* 4: Finance
* 5: Marketing
* 6: R&D
* 7: Sales
* 8: Manufacturing
* 9: TODO

## Operations
Unless otherwise denoted, all operands must be register names.
* increment `x`:
  * innovate `x`
* multiply `x` by 10:
  * amplify `x`
* multiply `x` by -1:
  * revamp `x`
* decrement `x`:
  * streamline `x`
* divide `x` by 10:
  * backburner `x`
* add `x` to `y` and store the result in `x`
  * synergize `x` with `y`
* subtract `y` from `x` and store the result in `x`
  * differentiate `x` from `y`
* define a label called `x`
  * moving forward, `x**`
* jump to label `x`
  * circle back to `x**`
* jump to label `x` if the value in `y` is zero
  * pivot `y` to `x**`
* jump to label `x` if the value in `y` is negative
  * restructure `y` to `x**`
* set `x` to `y`
  * align `x` with `y*`
* print `x` to stdout (in UTF-8 encoding)
  * deliver `x`
* set `x` to zero
  * overhaul `x`
* set `x` to a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive
  * paradigm shift `x`
* read a single UTF-8 character from stdin and store it in `x`
  * crowdsource `x`
* exit
  * take it offline

\* can be either a register name or a constant expression

\** can be any string containing no reserved words

## Constant expressions
A constant expression is a sequence of one or more constants separated by `,` or `and`. The value of the expression is the result of concatenating the values of the constants. For example, `Engineering` has a value of `1` and `Marketing` has a value of `5`, so the expression `Engineering and Marketing` has a value of `15`.

More examples:
* `Engineering, Marketing, and HR` = `150`
* `Engineering` = `1`
* `HR and Engineering` = `1` (leading zeros are ignored)
* `Marketing, Marketing, Marketing` = `555`

## Comments
The syntax of Strategic Communication meets or exceeds the highest standards of corporate communication, therefore comments are unnecessary and not supported.
