# strategic-communication
A best-of-breed language with a holistic approach to moving the needle

Operations:
* increment `x`:
  * innovate `x`
* multiply `x` by 10:
  * amplify `x`
* decrement `x`:
  * streamline `x`
* divide `x` by 10:
  * backburner `x`
* add `x` to `y` and store the result in `x`
  * synergize `x` with `y`
* subtract `y` from `x` and store the result in `x`
  * differentiate `x` from `y`
* define a label called `x`
  * moving forward, `x`
* jump to label `x`
  * circle back to `x`
* jump to label `x` if the value in `y` is zero
  * pivot `y` to `x`
* jump to label `x` if the value in `y` is negative
  * restructure `y` to `x`
* set `x` to `y`
  * align `x` with `y`
* print `x` to stdout (in UTF-8 encoding)
  * deliver `x`
* set `x` to zero
  * overhaul `x`
* set `x` to a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive
  * paradigm shift `x`
* read a single UTF-8 character from stdin and store it in `x`
  * crowdsource `x`
